         Self-learning is my greatest strength as I firmly believe that experience gained by doing is far more beneficial to an individual than mere learning. I can collaborate well in teams and work with diverse people. I also have experience in client interactions.
        </li>
    
        <li>My line of work from the previous company focused on customer relationship management which broadened my thinking on how to be in customers' shoes while delivering a solution. In Accenture, I was exposed to various technologies that included designing solutions for commissions and sales in SAP Callidus that involved solving change requests from end to end, presenting the cumulative sales reports to the clients, solving the support tickets whenever necessary.</li>

        <li>I used Microsoft Dynamics CRM, the state- of-the-art CRM technology that improved client sales, productivity and helped clients gain more visibility to the end-users’ activities. It helped me deal with many complex situations that one can encounter when involved in sales and marketing. This pondered my interest towards the union of business analysis and information technology.</li>

        <li>My coursework gave me an in-depth understanding of analyzing business use cases and equipped me with all the skills necessary for a business analyst. Altogether, I am a good fit for a business analyst role that involves dealing with customer relationships which develop solutions using cloud technologies such as SAP cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Microsoft CRM based on my extensive experience in the field.</li>
